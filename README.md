# 🌮 My TypeScript Template

This project is a template for a TypeScript project that uses Bun as the JavaScript runtime and Biome as the linter.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### First of all, you need to install the dependencies:

- [Bun](https://bun.sh) - Fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
- [Debian](https://www.debian.org/index.en.html) - Debian is a free operating system (OS) for your computer.

### Then, you need to install the project dependencies:

- [Bun](https://bun.sh) - Fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
- [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/) - The blazing fast and configurable linter.
- [CI/CD](https://github.com/features/actions) - Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment.

## 📦 Installation

We have two ways to install the project, using a development version or a production version.

### 🧪 Development Version

`1.` Install the dependencies:
```bash
bun install
```

`2.` Run the development script:
```bash
bun run dev
```

### 🚀 Production Version

`1.` Install the dependencies:
```bash
bun install
```

`2.` Build the project, this will generate a `dist` folder with the production build:
```bash
bun run build
```

`3.` Run the production build, this will execute the `dist/index.js` file:
```bash
bun run prod
```
